### Introduction

Timestamp Localizer for Loggly is an extension for Google Chrome that converts timestamps on Loggly.com from UTC to the browser's local time.  For whatever reason, the people behind Loggly have not provided this functionality directly from Loggly despite years of users requesting this feature so this extension seeks to fill that gap. 

This is a very preliminary version of this extension.  Bugs and oddities are to be expected!
